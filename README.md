# Linear Regression Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates a comprehensive implementation of Linear Regression. It includes data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation using statistical and machine learning techniques.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, scaling, and preparing data for modeling.
- **Feature Engineering**: Selecting optimal features using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Variance Inflation Factor (VIF).
- **Modeling**: Building and training a Linear Regression model using `scikit-learn`.
- **Visualization**: Utilizing `seaborn` and `matplotlib` for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model diagnostics.
- **Evaluation**: Metrics such as RÂ² and Mean Squared Error (MSE) are used to assess model performance.

## Libraries Used

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `seaborn`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`
- `statsmodels`

## Outputs
- Model performance metrics
- Visualizations for data analysis and model evaluation
- Statistical insights on feature importance
